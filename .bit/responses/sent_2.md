## Part 2: Sentence Analyzer - Word Counter
1. Create a new branch from `main` named `word`. 
2. Create a function named `word_counter` that takes in  a `sentence` string as a parameter and returns how many words.
3. Commit your code to the `word` branch. 
4. Create a pull request to merge the `word` branch onto `main`, and only merge the pull request when the bot approves your changes. 

> ❗ for this step, edit the `word_counter.js` file

### 🔨 Function Specs:
